    <h1>Embedded Programming</h1>

    <h2>Using AVRDude</h2>

    <p>Configuring the board with avrdude allows us to configure properties such as the microcontroller's clock rate.
    </p>

    <p>Since we have been issued the ATTiny85 instead of the ATTiny45, we can also use the shortcut T85.</p>

    <p>Use the C make file program to generate the program that we want to upload to the board</p>

    <h2>Software Installation</h2>

    <p>For this part on Embedded Programming, we will need to install several software.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Git Bash</li>
      <li>Zadig</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We first start by installing Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win .</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/EMBEDDEDPROGRAMMING/GITBASH1.png" width=75%>

    <p>We can download Zadig from https://zadig.akeo.ie/</p>

    <p>After this, we will also need to download some files and install them in their appropriate directories.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>AVR Toolchain</li>
      <li>AVR Dude</li>
      <li>GNU Make</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We can download AVRDude from http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/windows_avr.html </p>

    <p>Once downloaded, we'll extract it and copy it to our C://ProgramFiles Folder</p>

    <p>We will also need to update our PATH once we are done installing our files in our directories. Simply type 'PATH'
      into the windows search box: </p>

    <p>I also changed the MCU to the attiny85 from the attiny45 since we have been given tiny85s instead of tiny45s.
    </p>




    <h2>Setting up the Arduino as an ISP programmer</h2>

    <p>We'll be using SpenceKonde's ATTinyCore library which is hosted on github at:
      https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore</p>

    <p>There are 2 ways to setting up the Arduino IDE to act as an ISP programmer for our TINY85 target board.</p>

    <p>Firstly, there is the manual installation method. Download a package and extract it and copy it to the Arduino
      Library folder</p>

    <p>Secondly, there is the board manager url method, copy the URL to the Arduino library manager and it will
      automatically install the library. Since method is simpler due to only requiring a copy and paste of a link and
      a restart of the Arduino IDE and clicking of buttons, I will be using this method. The first method's
      documentation can be found in the
      installation tab on SpenceKonde's repository.</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/EMBEDDEDPROGRAMMING/Arduinoconfigure.png" width=75%>

    <p>Simply copy "http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json" and paste it in the "Additional Boards Managers
      URLs" field.</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/EMBEDDEDPROGRAMMING/Arduinoconfigure2.png" width=75%>

    <p>After restarting Arduino, we can now configure the settings for our Tiny85 board, such as the clock at which
      the Tiny85 is operating at, which Tiny chip we are using, etc</p>

    <p>After restarting Arduino, we'll head to our library manager where we'll finish off the installation by searching
      for 'Tiny' which will cause SpenceKonde's library to pop up. Click on 'Install'</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/EMBEDDEDPROGRAMMING/Arduinoconfigure3.png" width=75%>

    <p>We can now select the Tiny25/45/85 as our board:</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/EMBEDDEDPROGRAMMING/Arduinoconfigure4.png" width=75%>

    <p>One important thing to note is not to select an external clock in the Arduino IDE unless you have an external
      clock connected to the microcontroller. This will cause the
      board to stop working as it will keep waiting for an external clock at its clock pin. </p>

    <h3>Burning the Bootloader</h3>

    <p>If we change the internal clock frequency that the board is operating at, we will have to go into Arduino and
      'burn bootloader'. This will change the fuses to the appropriate setting. </p>

    <h3>Uploading the .ino file to the target board</h3>

    <p>Since we are using an ISP programmer and a target board, uploading to the target board will be slightly
      different from a traditional Arduino Uno.</p>

    <p>Instead of clicking the upload to board button at the top left of the IDE, we will have to go through "Tools"
      and "Upload using programmer", as compared to a traditional Arduino Uno or Mega.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>

    <p>For our assignment, we have been tasked with reading a datasheet and programming our target board to do stuff.
    </p>
    <p>Programming the board to do stuff, send a button press through serial monitor or something</p>

    <h2>Reading a datasheet</h2>

    <p>Since I have already built a Tiny85 board, I will use its datasheet here.</p>

    <p>We first start by searching for 'Tiny85 datasheet' in our search engine of choice.</p>

    <p>Insert image here of first search result</p>

    <p>The first search result here is from microchip showing the tiny25,45 and 85 datasheets.</p>

    <p>After clicking it, we get this:</p>

    <p>insert image here of cover page of the datasheet</p>


    <h3>Feature/Summary page</h3>

    <p>Here we can see a brief summary of the features of the Tiny25/45/85 family.</p>

    <h3>1) Pin configuration:</h3>

    <p>In this section of the datasheet, we can see that the Tiny25/45/85 microcontrollers are available in both
      PDIP/SOIC/TSSOP and QFN/MLF packages.</p>

    <h3>2) </h3>



    <h2>Programming our target board:</h2>

    <p>Programming our target board with the Arduino as an ISP is almost the same as a regular Arduino Uno or Mega.
    </p>

    <p>Before programming our target board, we will first have to refer to the datasheet to understand the Pinout of
      the Tiny85.</p>


    <h3>Simple LED blinking</h3>

    <p>From my schematic, I know that I have my switch connected to PB3 and LED connected to PB4.</p>

    <p>I wrote a simple blink program for my board:</p>

    <video width=75% controls>

      <source src="IMAGES/EMBEDDEDPROGRAMMING/boardblinkvideo.mp4" width=75%>

    </video>

    <p>As seen from the code, the LED lights up for half a second where it is the pin it is connected to is set to HIGH,
      followed by another half a second
      where it is LOW, hence it blinking.</p>

    <h3>Using the push button to control the LED</h3>
