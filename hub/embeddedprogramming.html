    <h1>Embedded Programming</h1>

    <h2>Using AVRDude</h2>

    <p>Configuring the board with avrdude allows us to configure properties such as the microcontroller's clock rate.
    </p>

    <p>Since we have been issued the ATTiny85 instead of the ATTiny45, we can also use the shortcut T85.</p>

    <p>Use the C make file program to generate the program that we want to upload to the board</p>

    <h2>Software Installation</h2>

    <p>For this part on Embedded Programming, we will need to install several software.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Git Bash</li>
      <li>Zadig</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We first start by installing Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win .</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/EMBEDDEDPROGRAMMING/GITBASH1.png" width=75%>

    <p>We can download Zadig from https://zadig.akeo.ie/</p>

    <p>After this, we will also need to download some files and install them in their appropriate directories.</p>

    <ul>
  
      <li>AVR Toolchain</li>
      <li>AVR Dude</li>
      <li>GNU Make</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We can download AVRDude from http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/windows_avr.html </p>

    <p>Once downloaded, we'll extract it and copy it to our C://ProgramFiles Folder</p>

    <p>We will also need to update our PATH once we are done installing our files in our directories. Simply type 'PATH' into the windows search box: </p>

    <p>I also changed the MCU to the attiny85 from the attiny45 since we have been given tiny85s instead of tiny45s.
    </p>




    <h2>Setting up the Arduino as an ISP programmer</h2>

    <p>https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore</p>

    <p>There are 2 ways to setting up the Arduino IDE to act as an ISP programmer for our TINY85 target board.</p>

    <p>Firstly, there is the manual installation method. Download a package and extract it and copy it to the Arduino Library folder</p>

    <p>Secondly, there is the board manager url method, copy the URL to the Arduino  and it will automatically install the library. Since I'm lazy I will be using this method.</p>

    <img src="IMAGES/EMBEDDEDPROGRAMMING/Arduinoconfigure.png" width=75%>

    <p>Simply copy "http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json" and paste it in the "Additional Boards Managers URLs" field.</p>

    <p>Insert image here of new settings and properly configured.</p>

    <p>After restarting Arduino, we can now </p>

    <p>One important thing to note is not to use external clock unless you have an external clock connected to the microcontroller. This will cause the
      board to stop working as it will keep waiting for an external clock at its clock pin. </p>

    <h3>Burning Bootloader</h3>

    <p>If we change the internal clock frequency that the board is operating at, we will have to go into Arduino and 'burn bootloader'. This is due to the fuses  </p>

    <h3>Uploading the .ino file to the target board</h3>

    <p>Since we are using an ISP programmer and a target board, uploading to the target board will be slightly different from a traditional Arduino Uno.</p>

    <p>Instead of clicking the upload to board button at the top left of the IDE, we will have to </p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>

    <p>For our assignment, we have been tasked with reading a datasheet and programming our target board to do stuff.
    </p>
    <p>Programming the board to do stuff, send a button press through serial monitor or something</p>

    <h2>Reading a datasheet</h2>

    <p>Since I have already built a Tiny85 board, I will use its datasheet here.</p>

    <p>We first start by searching for 'Tiny85 datasheet' in our search engine of choice.</p>

    <p>Insert image here of first search result</p>

    <p>The first search result here is from microchip showing the tiny25,45 and 85 datasheets.</p>

    <p>After clicking it, we get this:</p>

    <p>insert image here of cover page of the datasheet</p>


    <h3>Feature/Summary page</h3>

    <p>Here we can see a brief summary of the features of the Tiny25/45/85 family.</p>

    <h3>1) Pin configuration:</h3>

    <p>In this section of the datasheet, we can see that the Tiny25/45/85 microcontrollers are available in both
      PDIP/SOIC/TSSOP and QFN/MLF packages.</p>

    <h3></h3>


    <h2>Programming our target board:</h2>

    <p>Programming our target board with the Arduino as an ISP is almost the same as a regular Arduino Uno or Mega.</p>

    <p>Before programming our target board, we will first have to refer to the datasheet to understand the Pinout of the Tiny85.</p>

    <p>We will need to know the pinout to properly set-up our board.</p>

    <p>We will also </p>
